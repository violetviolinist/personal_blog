  Hi, I am Jay Parekh, a software engineer from Mumbai, India. I love JavaScript, and have programmed in it on both the backend (Node.js) and the frontend. I write here about JS, Node, the web, films, and other things.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I have grown frustrated by how bloated the web has become with overuse of clunky JS frameworks and libraries, and animations (the tipping point was Safari on my Macbook Pro struggling to display a page on *apple*.com). What has come out of this is an ongoing effort to learn to live without JS, to rebuild my relationship with it on healthier terms.
</p>

<p>
  I also write about performance on high-scale Node.js applications.
</p>

<p>
  And rant about everything under the sun.
